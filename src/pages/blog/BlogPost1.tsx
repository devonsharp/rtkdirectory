          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is RTK?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) is a satellite navigation technique that enhances the precision of position data 
            derived from satellite-based positioning systems like GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou. RTK uses a fixed 
            base station and a mobile receiver to provide real-time corrections, achieving centimeter-level accuracy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The base station continuously observes satellite signals and compares the measured ranges to the known distances. 
            Any discrepancies are transmitted as correction data to the mobile receiver, which applies these corrections 
            to achieve highly accurate positioning.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How RTK Correction Services Work</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            RTK correction services operate through a network of reference stations that continuously monitor satellite signals. 
            Here's how the process works:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Reference Station Monitoring:</strong> Fixed reference stations with precisely known coordinates continuously track satellite signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Calculation:</strong> These stations calculate the difference between observed and expected satellite signal characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction Transmission:</strong> Correction data is transmitted to users via radio, cellular, or internet connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time Processing:</strong> User receivers apply corrections in real-time to achieve centimeter-level accuracy.</li>
          </ol>
